# phpjade-sass-coffee-project-template

A starting point for a project that uses PHP, Jade, Sass and Coffeescript.

This requires <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank">npm</a>.

cd to the directory in terminal

```
npm install
grunt
```

This then watches for changes of .jade files in the root, .sass files in the 'sass' folder, and .coffee files in the 'coffee' folder, easily configurable in the Gruntfile.js.
